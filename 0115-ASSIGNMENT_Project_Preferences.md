# Project Preferences

During the first week of class you are expected to review project proposals and provide information about yourself and your preferences so that the instructor can do team assignments.  Note that not everyone will get their first or even their second project choices.  However, your instructors will do their best to build teams that match your interests and have the skills necessary to be successful.
