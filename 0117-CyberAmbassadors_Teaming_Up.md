# 1. Team Assignments

By now you should have received an email from your instructor with your assigned project and team names/emails. We will breakout into your teams for today's activities. Some things to note:

* You all should now have access to a private channel for your team.  Please verify that all team members have access to the channel as well as the instructors.   
* Teams are expected to sit together in class.  Since our classroom has monitors at each table, at the beginning of each class each team will be expected to put up a slide on their screen with as a "team name tag". This slide will include the team name, the community partner logo (if there is one) and a list of all members of the team.  

Reminder, the [Project Orginization assignment](0121-ASSIGNMENT_Project_Organization) is due on Sunday

# 3. D2L Quiz
Sometime before Friday log onto D2L and complete the quick quiz in the content section. Don't stress about these quizzes they are not worth much. I just ask you put in your best effort.
