If you are interested in an Honor's option, please review the option in the syllabus and send an email to your instructors **TODAY** saying you would like to be included in the Documentation management team. 

# 1. Temporary Groups

When class starts your instructor will break everyone up into temporary groups. Once you are in your groups, introduce yourselves and pick project roles (see below).

As soon as you get into your groups introduce yourselves and identify people for the following roles.  

### Reviewer/Researcher:
Everyone on the team is responsible to to review and research the proposal. Your job is to use your favorite search engines and see what you can learn immediately about the project. Pretend that this will be your project and you are trying to find the information you need to get started.  This includes information such as software resources, background information, data sources, etc.  Include links and descriptions of what you find. Think about the first steps and open loop questions that need to be answered. 

### Timekeeper:
In your groups you have 30 minutes to complete the review and get ready for the presentation.  The timekeeper is responsible for the agenda and keeping your team on task. Here is a recommendation:
* (5 minutes) To read through the project description. Maybe have someone read it out loud?
* (10 minutes) Have everyone research details about the projects.  
* (5 minutes) Review report and add additional items as your team finds them.
* (10 minutes) Pick 2-3 items you think would be good to report out to the class. 

### Note Taker:  
The note taker will be responsible for taking notes for the meeting.  These notes will be shared with the rest of the class. If you are the note taker, do the following:
* Create a word document in the General-->Files-->Project_Reviews titled TEAMNAME_Review.docx. Do not use spaces in the filename. The TEAMNAME is the name of the project your team is reviewing.
* Add the title of the project to the top of the document. Include all of your names and your assigned roles.
* Write down notes and thoughts about the project. Make sure you include links to online resources.
* Make sure the notes make sense.

### Facilitator:
Your job is to make sure everyone is participating and working.  Encourage discussion and help the timekeeper and note takers stay on task. Focus on making sure others are participating and not taking over the discussion yourself. 

### Presenter
Your job is to present the 2-3 items your team picks to the entire group.  You will only have a maximum of 3 minutes to present so make sure you know what you want to say. If you have time write it down and practice.  


# 2. Project Review

Your goal for the next half hour is to review a project as a group and do some preliminary research. Get out your computers so everyone can help.  After your 30 minutes you need to be ready to give a 3-minute presentation (max) to the entire class about the 2-3 most interesting things you found. The goal here is to share something new that may be helpful for other classmates to know as they pick projects. Practice if you have time so you can keep it under 3 minutes. 


# 3. Sharing Review results

Each group will get about 3 minutes to share some details about the project they reviewed.
