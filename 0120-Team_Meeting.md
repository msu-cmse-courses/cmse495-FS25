## Class Agenda

Make sure you sit with your team.  One person on the team plug in their computer and post their "team name tag" on one or both of the monitors. You will be expected to do this each class without reminders. Remember your team name tag should include:

- Team Name

# Understanding Git

It is assumed that you have been introduced to git in previous classes. We will be using it a lot in this class. Students that are uncomfortable with git may want to review the following tutorials. It is the entire teams responsibility to help your fellow members learn and use git properly:
