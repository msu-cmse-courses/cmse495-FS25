# Anticipating Challenges


## Agenda (80 Minutes)

- (10 minutes) Example Case Study
- (10 minutes) Team Paring Exercise
- (10 minutes) Team Charter Review
- (40 minutes) Group Case Studies
- (10 minutes) Sharing with the class

# Example Case Study: Not Enough Training Data
For the next exercise your groups will review one of the case studies in your handout. However, to get some practice, you instructor will lead a case study for the entire class and give you an idea what you should be doing. 

# Team Paring Exercise

This is a team paring exercise.  Your instructors will pair up teams in groups of 2 or 3.  Combine your teams and split up in to 2-3 groups (some people from each team). Each group pick one of the team charters to review.  Ensure that the final groups consist of 4-5 people and that every team charter will be reviewed.  
 


| Team A | Team B | 
|--------|--------| 
| SME - Crack Prediction | Kinesiology - 40 yard dash |
| NC3 - Community Capital | Henry Ford Hospital - Image Segmentation |
| Kellogg - Deduction Classification | Olson - Campain finance Data |
| Intramotev  - Autonomous Vehicles | QSIDE - Human trafficking |
| D2L - Instructor API | CEPI - Anomaly Detection |
| Boeing - Defect Prediction | QSIDE - Justfare Toolbox |
| Neogen - Pesticide Analysis | Neogen - Pesticide Analysis|

# Team Charter Review

Review the team charter assigned to your team. Have someone from the team that wrote the team charter present it to the group (10 minutes).  Discuss key features and how you try to anticipate challenges for the semester.  Have the group come up with ideas to make the team charter even better.

# Group Case Studies

As a group, review the handout of case studies. You should have time to get through about four of them.  We don't want all groups to do the same four so the instructor may ask you to start on a specific number.  Spend about 10 minutes per case study by doing the following:

- Pick someone to take notes
- Pick someone to read the case study out loud and have a discussion
- Discuss the questions at the end of the case study.
- Focus on the question "What could be added to your team charter that may help avoid this type of problem?"

# Sharing with the class

In the last 10 minutes of class your instructor will have groups share what they learned with the class.  The important outcome will be ideas you think are good to add to the team charter to help anticipate challenges that may occur throughout the semester. 

# Introduce Project Schedule assignment

The next deliverable is the project plan and schedule.  Teams will use this time to read though the assignment and work on getting ready for the next steps.
