I would like to use this as an opportunity to do some shout outs.  Please think about people both inside and outside the class who have helped you so far.  Use this as an opportunity to speak up and thank them.

# Project Plan Reviews

Exchange project plans with another team (figure out how to connect with them and send the document, a pdf is fine):

| Team A | Team B | 
|--------|--------|
| HFH - Revenue Cycle Prediction | City of Grand Rapids - Social Impact |
| Kellanova - Point of Sale Analysis | Tribal Start Program - Tribal Early Childhood Research Data |
| Techsmith - Healthy and Engaged User Data Exploration | ICER - User Data Analytics |
| HAP - Synthetic Data Generation | CEPI - Anomaly Detection |
| Intramotev - Automated Video Data Labeling for Autonomous Trains | Ford - Defect Prediction |
| TwoSix - LLM to Graphs | QSIDE - SToPA: MultiTown Data Analysis |

As a group review their proposal and provide them some constructive feedback.  The more you can provide the better.  Some things to think about include the following:

- Did you understand the goal and plan for this project? If not, what questions were not answered?
- Do you have any recommendations for the other team.
- Did reading though this proposal give you any ideas for your own teams project?
- Are their ways your teams could collaborate?
- Does the timeline look sufficient for completing the project?
- Are their any challenges the team may have failed to anticipate?
- Based on what you know, what grade would you give this proposal and why? (This is only as instructors)


When typing up the proposal feedback, try to avoid words like you/your when giving criticism (criticize the project not the people). Even better, word your criticisms as specific suggestions for improvements.  

When you are done writing up your feedback, share your notes with the other team and the instructors.  Read over your own teams feedback and ask for any clarifications.
