# In-Class Assignment: Pull Request

This week we will practice issueing a "pull request" from a git repository. 


## Agenda (80 Minutes)

- (5 minutes) Fix Instructor's Issue Mistake
- (55 minutes) Group Review of the Data Tools Tutorial Demo (DTTD)
- (20 minutes) Group co-work time


# 1. Fix instructor's issue  mistake

Turns out I didn't think through the git repository and put it on github instead of gitlab.  I need the repository on gitlab because it uses MSU NETID and I can track grading.  Your first step is to go find your issue in the github repository and Copy/Paste it to the new GitLab Repository

* [OLD Github DataTools on Github (no longer using)](https://github.com/colbrydi/DataTools_Tutorial_Demo)
* [NEW Gitlab DataTools Tutorial Demo (DTTD)](https://gitlab.msu.edu/CMSE/datatools_tutorial_demo)

You need to do this to get credit for the issues project from last week.

# Notes for making Pull Requests

Use some of your time to remind yourself how to issue a pull request and do the following:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Make and checkout a branch
4. Make and commit your changes (making sure to reference the issue you are fixing)
5. Push your changes to your fork and make 

Note, although you can make changes using the GitLAB website it is highly recommended that you use this time to practice/learn how to make proper pull requests using the command line.  If you don't know how find yourself a video or tutorial.

# Getting Credit for this assignment

Each member of the team should submit at least a different pull request.  Try to coordinate so that pull requests do not conflict with each other. Your instructors will review and merge the pull requests. 

NOTE: I realize we are using a lot of jargon. This is normal when you start a new job. Please research anything you don't understand and talk with your team. Come to your instructor with questions if you can't figure out something together.
