For this assignment you and your team will "storyboard" your plans for a 5-6 minute video for your project proposal. Tap into your own creativity.  Make something you are proud of and would want to post on-line or include in a presentation. 

We will use time in class to watch the videos, answer questions and provide feedback.

**_NOTE_**:  Your instructor assumes that you are well past the proposal stage and are actively working on closing your open loops.

# 1. Storyboarding

Step one is to plan what you want your presentation will include.  Use a Microsoft PowerPoint to plan what they are going to say and the order they will say it in.  This is a good first step. Although your final video does not need to use slides, use this project draft as a way to make a "[storyboarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard)" for your video to know what parts you want to include and what you don't want to include. 

Prepare the presentation for a general audience.  Make something that you could show to in-coming data science student (or a family member) to get them excited about the project. Also remember that your sponsor will be watching this presentation so think of this as an opportunity to "Wow" them. 

Some things to consider for your storyboard:

- Include who will be speaking for each slide. (All members of the team should talk).
- Use the notes field in the slide show program to outline what you want to say for each section of the video. 
- Include introductions for group members.  
- Describe the overall goals of the project.
- Describe the major **_open-loops_** that will need to be solved (closed).  
- Describe the expected successful outcomes and include any major success metrics you will use. 
- Plan not exceed the 10 minute talk length.

We really want to see creativity and professionalism.  Think outside of slides and talking. Demonstrate to us why your project is awesome!

Let your instructor know what you are thinking, we may be able to show you some easy to use tools to produce your vision.

# 2. Submission

Include a copy of the storyboard in your teams drive as a PowerPoint file. Give it a reasonable name so the instructor does not need to hunt for it. The title of the email should be "**_GROUP_NAME-CMSE495_Proposal_Storyboard_**".

# 3. Grading Rubric

These storyboard slides will be graded on good effort attempt to follow directions and complete the project. Instructors will give feedback on the slides so that students can integrate changes before the presentation date.
