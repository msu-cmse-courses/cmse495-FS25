# Shout Outs

Do we have any shout outs for this week?  How are things going?


# Next Week! Proposal Presentations

Next you will be giving your proposal presentations.  You have all week to your presentation and it will be played to the class next Monday.  Due to the size of the class we will be efficient on how videos will be reviewed.

This is one of three major presentations this semester.  Make sure you practice! You will be given 5-6 minutes for your presentation. Use the time wisely.


# Project Similarities

Your instructor wants to do an experiment.  Let's take some time try to understand each other's projects and figure out how they are similar and they are different. This will be a individual judgment call but may be based on information such as:

- Similar language Used in the project
- Similar libraries and software you plan to use
- Similar Data used in projects (Text, Time, image, etc.)
- Similar modeling techniques
- Similar project sponsors
- etc. 

To make things easier we will identify and share project attributes.  For this exercise we will use the following shared document to keep track of notes:

## Step 1: Class brainstorming
As a class, let's brainstorm QUESTIONS that you and the other teams can answer to help align your projects.  For this lets have about three volunteers act as scribes to fill in this document. 


## Step 2: Group work
Once we all agree we have a reasonable set of questions. In your groups, spend about 10-15 minutes trying to answer all of the questions.  


## Step 3: Individual Opinions
Once you have a good feel about the projects, fill out the following distance matrix as best you can.  Start with your project and assign the value of zero (0) then rank all of the remaining projects on a scale of 1-9 with 1 being the most similar and 9 being the least similar.  This is a personal perception of the project (don't just copy a teammates).
