# In-Class Assignment: DTTD Presentations


## Agenda (80 Minutes)

- (15 minutes) Finish up DTTD presentations
- (65 minutes) Team DTTD presentations

# 1. Finish DTTD Presentations

Get back into your groups and finish your presentations. I highly recommend that each group practice. You will only have a few minutes (no more than 5) so it is important to get it right.  Here are some things you should highlight.

- Which tutorial did you review?
- What did you learn?
- Which teams do you think could benefit from the tutorial? Why?
- What could be done to make it better?


# 2. DTTD Presentations

We will go around the room and give presentations. Be respectful of everyone's time.
