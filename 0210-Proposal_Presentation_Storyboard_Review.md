# Shout Outs

Do we have any shout outs for this week?  How are things going?


### Next Week! Proposal Presentations

Next you will be giving your proposal presentations.  You have all week to your presentation and it will be played to the class next Monday.  Due to the size of the class we will be efficient on how videos will be reviewed.

This is one of three major videos this semester.  You will be given 3-5 minutes for your video. Use the time wisely.


# Project Similarities

Let's take some time try to understand each other's projects and figure out how they are similar and they are different. This will be a individual judgment call but may be based on information such as:

- Similar language Used in the project
- Similar libraries and software you plan to use
- Similar Data used in projects (Text, Time, image, etc.)
- Similar modeling techniques
- Similar project community partners
- etc. 

To make things easier we will identify and share project attributes.  

## Step 1: Team Meeting
As a class let's review the questions in the following form.   Let the instructors know if there is a question or option missing.  We may be able to do a live update of the form. 

Once all updates have been made, have your team agree on answers and have one person (only one) from each team fill out the form:

## Step 2: Review Results
When your team is done, review the results of the survey from all of the teams here:

This document may be tricky to interpret so feel free to download the document and review the results.


## Step 3: Individual Opinions
Once you have a good feel about the projects, fill out the following distance matrix as best you can.  Start with your project and assign the value of zero (0) then rank all of the remaining projects on a scale of 1-9 with 1 being the most similar and 9 being the least similar.  This is a personal perception of the project (don't just copy a teammates).

# Storyboard Review

This is a team paring exercise.  Your team will work with your tripod to review your Project Plan video storyboards.   

| Tripod | Team A | Team B | Team C |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | CEPI | HFH_RC | MSU_WD |
| 2 | HFH_MT | HFH_QC | MSU_GR |
| 3 | HAP    | HFH_PP | TechSmith |
| 4 | Documenters | Grassroots | TwoSix | 
| 5 | MSU_HC | MSU_JO | QSIDE |

Have your tripods exchange links to your video storyboard.  Review another team's storyboard and write an email report for the instructor and the other team. This report should provide the following:

- List the proposal team name and the evaluator team name.
- Ideas for making the video better.

Make sure you title the email and make it clear your group name and the group you are reviewing).  Email the group and the instructors to get credit.
