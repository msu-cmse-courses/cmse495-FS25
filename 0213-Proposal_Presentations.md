# Proposal Presentations


Today we will go around the room and answer questions about our project videos. There should be enough time for everyone to get though the presentations and questions. However, if we go over we will continue them on Wednesday.  

## Agenda (80 Minutes)

- (20 minutes) Shout outs and peer review
- (60 minutes) Videos and questions 5-10 minutes each
