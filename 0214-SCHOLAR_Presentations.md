# 1. SCHOLAR Cleaning

I would like to use the time today to clean out the rest of the issues and verify everything is working in the current repository.

## Individual Goals

- Review the issue you submitted. Was it fixed?  Is it closed? If not, why?  
- Review the pull request you submitted.  Did it get merged into the repository?  If not, does it need to be? 

## Class Goals

- Clean out all of the issues except the open ones that can not immediately be addressed.
- Merge any new pull requests that are generated. 
- Verify all of the tutorials are working as expected. 


# 2. Class Review of SCHOLAR

As a class we will review the cleaned and updated repository. With a final check of the issues and the pull requests. 

# 3. Group Work

Use the remaining of the hour to do group work.
