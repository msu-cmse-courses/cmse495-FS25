The goal of this milestone is to share what you are doing with the community outside the classroom (without violating your NDAs).  Teams will put together a blog post (news article) and a single PowerPoint Slide to highlight their project and their community partners.  The blog post will go on the course website (and may be highlighted on either the department, college or even university website) and the slides will be used on the hallway TVs outside the main CMSE office and maybe also on the website.  You can also use this short description in your project README or as part of your final report abstract. 

Be creative, this is a fairly simple milestone (on purpose so you can be working on your primary project goals), however it is also an opportunity to show off a bit and share what you are doing with friends, family and possibly even future employers. 

**_WARNING_** You are responsible for ensuring the content in your slides do not violate your NDAs or copyright laws.  Check with your community partner if you need verification. 


## PowerPoint Slide
Here are some guild lines for the slide:

- Please use a 16:9 ratio (1920 x 1080 pixels) slide so that it will appear nicely on the hallway TVs.
- Minimize the use of too many words. Use large fonts to make it easy to read.
- Whenever Possible use striking visuals. 
- Only use the community partner logo if approval has been given by the community partners. 
- Include the team name and member names (with everyone's consent).
- Simple animations will be allowed in the sides (if they are appropriate).
- Thank the community partner in some way.

## Blog Post
Here are some guild lines for the blog post:

- Try to keep the post to around 1000 words.
- Include an image with the post. This image should visually represent the project in some way (more than just the logo). A team picture would be appropriate. 
- Include the team name and member names (with everyone's consent).
- Describe how the project is important for the community partner.
- Highlight what you are learning.
- Thank the community partner in some way.



# Submission

To turn in the assignment, place a copy in your team drive and email the links to your instructors. Make sure these files are turned in on or before the due date. 

Also, put a copy of your showcase slideshow in the "General" channel folder labeled (showcase slideshow).

# Evaluation

This assignment will be graded on good effort attempt to follow directions and complete the project.  Points will be taken off for the use of any images that are in violation of copyright.  

# Post Evaluation

Updates to your slides are allowed all semester long. Just send an email to your instructors notifying them of the update and we will post them in the hallway.
