# Shout Outs

Do we have any shout outs for this week?  How are things going?

---

#  Showcase slides

Please put a copy of your showcase slideshow in the "General" channel folder labeled (showcase slideshow).  I need a team of volunteers from different groups (about 3 or 4) to turn these slides into a automated slideshow ( you can use a breakout room).  

# Group Meeting

The rest of the class will work on their projects.

# Showcase Display and wrap-up

When the breakout group is done, they will present the slides to the instructor and we will put them on the overhead to discuss.
