# Tutorial Selection Presentations and Collision Detection

Each group will spend about 3 minutes showing us their selection metric and telling the class which tutorial they are planning to add for the DTTD.   If we have more than one group choose a tutorial we will come up with a method to merge the conflict. 

**_NOTE_**: Teams and individuals are welcome to add additional tutorials in their free time.  Instructors may even provide extra credit but this is not guaranteed.

# Work on Group Tutorial

Work on the group tutorials you selected.  When you are done with your tutorial submit it to the DTTD repository as a pull request.  Your instructors will accept the pull request (DO NOT BREAK THE BUILD).  Once your team has successfully submitted their tutorial you can work on your projects.
