# Tutorial Selection Presentations and Collision Detection

Each group will spend about 3 minutes showing us their selection metric and telling the class which tutorial they are planning to add for the DTTD.   If we have more than one group choose a tutorial we will come up with a method to merge the conflict. 

**_NOTE_**: Teams and individuals are welcome to add additional tutorials in their free time.  Instructors may even provide extra credit but this is not guaranteed.

# Work on Group Tutorial

Use the remainder of the class period to work on the tutorials you selected.  This is a multi-week in-class assignment and your instructors assume that you will not finish the tutorials today. You will also be given the entire class period on the Friday after break (March 17th) to finish up the tutorial and you will be presenting it as a demo in class on Friday March 24th.
