## Tutorial Development

Today we will be working on finishing up your tutorials and submitting pull requests for DTTD.  

When you finish your tutorial submit it to the DTTD repository as a pull request.  The DTTD managment team will accept the pull request (DO NOT BREAK THE BUILD). 

Once you have successfully submitted your pull request you can practice a 3-5 minute demo presentation for next week during class. During the demo, assume that each of your audience members can look up the tutorial on their computer and follow along.
