For this assignment you and your team will "storyboard" your second presentation video for your project beta demo. Tap into your own creativity.  Make something you are proud of and would want to post on-line or include in a presentation. 

We will use time in class to watch the videos, answer questions and provide feedback.

# 1. Storyboarding

For this project milestone you will make a "[storyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard)" for your second video that will provide a beta demo of your project.  This video will be shared with your project sponsor so we would like it to look professional and polished.  Feel free to make a copy of your previous storyboard and build off it. Cleaver teams can even reuse some of the video components. 

A storyboard helps in planning a video and makes sure you keep in your time frame.  Typically a storyboard is a series of images or drawings which include the following components: 

* Description or image of what will be seen in the video.
* Draft script of what will be said during the video.
* Planned time for each component of the video. 

One of the best tools for building a storyboard are Google Slides or PowerPoint. Use the slide to show or describe what will be displayed and then use the notes box to indicate the time spent and show a draft script of what will be said. 

Note, a common mistake is to think of a presentation as only slides.  We want you to include sources of video besides slides, however, your storyboard should still outline what you are planning. 

Prepare the presentation for a general audience.  Make something that you could show to in-coming data science student (or a family member) to get them excited about the project. Also remember that your community partner will be watching this presentation so think of this as an opportunity to "Wow" them. 

Some things to consider for your storyboard:

- Include who will be speaking for each component. (All members of the team should talk).
- Use the notes field in the slide show program to outline what you want to say for each component of the video.
- Use the notes field in the slide show program to estimate the time spent in each component.
- Include introductions for group members.  
- Describe the overall goals of the project.
- Show the end-to-end solution and your preliminary results. 
- Describe what still needs to be finished. 
- Plan not exceed the 10 minute talk length.

We really want to see creativity and professionalism.  Think outside of slides and talking. Demonstrate to us why your project is awesome!

Let your instructor know what you are thinking, we may be able to show you some easy to use tools to produce your vision.

# 2. Submission

Include a copy of the storyboard in your teams drive as a PowerPoint file. Give it a reasonable name so the instructor does not need to hunt for it. 

Send an email to the instructor with a link to the storyboard. The title of the email should be "**_GROUP_NAME-CMSE495_Beta_Demo_Storyboard_**".

# 3. Evaluation

These storyboard slides will be graded on good effort attempt to follow directions and complete the project. Instructors will give feedback on the slides so that students can integrate changes before the presentation date.

# 4. Post Evaluation

Review the feedback from your classmates and slides. Add additional information to your storyboard and finish making the video.
