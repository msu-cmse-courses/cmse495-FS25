For this assignment you and your team will "storyboard" your second presentation video to demo your Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Tap into your own creativity.  Make something you are proud of and would want to post on-line or include in a presentation. 

We will use time in class to watch the videos, answer questions and provide feedback.

# 1. Storyboarding

For this project milestone you will make a "[storyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard)" for your second video that will provide a Minimum Viable Product Demo of your project.  This video will be shared with your project sponsor so we would like it to look professional and polished.  Feel free to make a copy of your previous storyboard and build off it. Cleaver teams can even reuse some of the video components. 

A storyboard helps in planning a video and makes sure you keep in your time frame (3-5 minutes).  Typically a storyboard is a series of images or drawings which include the following components: 

* Description or image of what will be seen in the video.
* Draft script of what will be said during the video (use the notes field).
* Planned time for each component of the video. 

One of the best tools for building a storyboard are a slide tool such as PowerPoint. Use the slide to show or describe what will be displayed and then use the notes box to indicate the time spent and use the notes section to draft script of what will be said.

# 2. Submission

Include a copy of the storyboard in your teams drive as a PowerPoint file. Give it a reasonable name so the instructor does not need to hunt for it. 

Send an email to the instructor with a link to the storyboard. The title of the email should be "**_GROUP_NAME-CMSE495_MVP_Storyboard_**".

# 3. Evaluation

These storyboard slides will be graded on good effort attempt to follow directions and complete the project. Instructors may provide feedback on the slides so that students can integrate changes before the presentation date.

---

# 4. Post Evaluation

Review the feedback from your classmates and slides. Add additional information to your storyboard and finish making the video.
