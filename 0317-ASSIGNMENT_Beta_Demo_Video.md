For this assignment you and your team will create and submit a 5-6 minute video demo of your project. Tap into your own creativity. This video will be given to your community partners.  Make something you are proud of and would want to post on-line or include in a presentation. 

We will use time in class to watch the videos, answer questions and provide feedback.

# Create video

Use the storyboard and the feedback from your previous assignment as a guild to making the video. Do not be afraid to deviate from the plan if you have a new and exciting idea.  

Prepare the presentation for a general audience.  Make something that you could show to in-coming data science student (or a family member) to get them excited about the project. Also remember that your community partner will be watching this presentation so think of this as an opportunity to "Wow" them. 

Some things to consider for your storyboard:

- Include who will be speaking for each part of the video. (All members of the team should talk).
- Make a script of what you want to say for each section of the video. 
- Include quick introductions for group members.  
- Describe the overall goals of the project.
- Describe your open-loops** and how you closed them.
- Describe how the work will be broken up and solved.
- **_Give a demo of your installation/program workflow_**
- Plan not exceed the 10 minute talk length.

We really want to see creativity.  Think outside of slides and talking. Demonstrate to us why your project is awesome!

Let your instructor know what you are thinking, we may be able to show you some easy to use tools to produce your vision. 

** An open-loop is a part of the project for which you do not know what your solution will include.

# Posting your video

You may post your video someplace accessible by your instructor and other students.  Probably the easiest place to post is on [YouTube](http://youtube.com/) using a personal Google Account. However, students can also post on the [MSU Mediaspace](http://mediaspace.msu.edu/) or just upload the file to your video file to a Google drive folder. Once up on MediaSpace you can limit access to only MSU people logged in that have access to the URL.  

Include a link to the URL in your git repository.  A good place would be to embed the video in your ```README.md``` file but you can also embed YouTube videos in a Jupyter notebook.

# Submission
Have one on your team email a link to the video (or file) to the community partners. Carbon Copy (CC) all members of your team (including yourself) and CC your instructors. The title of the email should be "**_GROUP_NAME-CMSE495_Beta_Demo_Presentation_Video_**".

Make sure you also include the link in your team git repository and the team final report.

# Evaluation

Videos will be graded for professionalism and completeness.  Instructors will count off points for poor quality sound or visualizations. This video will specifically want to see an end-to-end demo of the the entire workflow.  Show everything from inputs, to how the data is processed to outputs.

# Post-Submission

Put a copy of your video in the Project_Deliverables folder in your team drive.
