# MVP Video Feedback From

You must fill out this form 11 times (for all projects except your own).  I realize this is a lot but please do your best to provide useful feedback to your peers. 

Note, that some (NOT ALL) of your feedback and comments may be communicated with your peers.  This is intended to be anonymous. Please be professional and supportive in your feedback. Your participation in this process will influence your grade in the course. 

The following is a simplified list of the questions and scales.  Some student's find it helpful to copy/paste these questions in an editor and take notes on their feedback.  This list is designed to make that easier but is not required.  I would appreciate all feedback by the end of the day. However, let me know if you need more time.
