# Figure Reviews

This is a team paring exercise.  Your team will work with another team to review your figure notebooks. Combine your teams and split up in to two groups (some people from each team).  Have one group review your teams installation and figure instructions and the other group review the other teams instructions. 

| Team A | Team B |  
|--------|--------|
| Ford - Defect Prediction | ICER - User Data Analytics |
| HAP - Synthetic Data Generation | TwoSix - LLM to Graphs |
| Techsmith - Healthy and Engaged User Data Exploration | Kellanova - Point of Sale Analysis |
| HFH - Revenue Cycle Prediction | City of Grand Rapids - Social Impact |
| Intramotev - Automated Video Data Labeling for Autonomous Trains | QSIDE - SToPA: MultiTown Data Analysis |
| CEPI - Anomaly Detection | Tribal Start Program - Tribal Early Childhood Research Data |

## Agenda

- (5 minutes) Break up into two groups 
- (5 minutes) Quick Introductions. Identify a timekeeper, notetaker, code reviewer, and facilitator.
- (20 minutes) Review Figure instructions
- (10 minutes) Discussion and brainstorming about improvements
- (10 minutes) Finish typing up email to instructors

In your group, have someone that is not from the code development team to try to install the  software and review the figure instructions. Have the group members from the development team hold back and only give advice and support if there is a problem.  The idea is to streamline the process so that the figure instructions are sufficient for someone outside of the development team to be able to reproduce the figure (within reason) without needing to have a developer to help.   As a group take lots of notes and review the documentation to the development group some constructive feedback.  If you are a member of the code's development team, use this as an opportunity to fix problems as they are discovered. 

As a group, prepare a report for the instructor and the development team. This report should provide the following:

- List of the evaluation group members with an indication about which capstone team they are on.
- Was someone outside the development team able to understand and possibly reproduce the figure?  If not, what was the problem?
- What are the open loops still on the project?
- Is there anything that needed to be added to the code/instructions to make the project easier to understand?
- Was there anything you could add to the project to help make the project better?

This is a group effort, use the attached google document to submit the report to the instructors.
