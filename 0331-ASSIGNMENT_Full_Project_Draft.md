# Project Draft

In this assignment you will clean finish up the git structure to make it as easy as possible for others to use.  Since we are past our MVP presentation it is reasonable to assume that you can provide everything needed for someone else to review your project.  We have been doing pieces of this all semester but here we will add a few finishing touches to make the project complete. Specifically we need to put in enough structure such that someone else taking the course can get it up and running. This includes: 

1. Final Report outline and draft - This doesn't have to be complete but it also should have something written for most sections. 
2. Installation Instructions
3. Testing Instructions
4. NDA approved Examples 

In class on Monday you will be paired up with another team. Have a plan for how you will share your instructions with your partner team. This includes providing them with access to data, a draft of your report and any instructions they need to get things up and running.  It is highly recommended that you practice your plan before class to ensure everything is ready and in place. 

Please notify the instructor as soon as possible if you can not figure out a reasonable way to share without violating your NDA or IP agreements.  You can not use this as an excuse to not do the assignment.  The goal here is to provide feedback early enough that you can make changes.  This is a trial run for making robust and reproducible code. 

# Submission

To get credit for this assignment, send an email to all of your instructors with your plan. Come to class ready to share the same email once teams have been assigned.

# Evaluation

The assignment will be evaluated based on how well the instructions are able to lead the other team to reproduce your current results.  Points will be taken off for missing or confusing steps.

### Congratulations, you are done!

Now, you just need to commit and push the project changes to your project git repository.
