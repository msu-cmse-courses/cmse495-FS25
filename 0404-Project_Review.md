# Project Code Review

This is a team paring exercise.  Your team will work with another team to review your projects. Combine your teams and split up in to two groups (some people from each team).  Have one group review your team's project and the other group review the other team's project. You can decide how best to share your repositories.  **_Make sure not to violate any NDA_**

## Agenda

- (5 minutes) Break up into two groups 
- (5 minutes) Quick Introductions. Identify a timekeeper, notetaker, code reviewer, and facilitator.
- (20 minutes) Project review
- (10 minutes) Discussion and brainstorming about improvements 
- (10 minutes) Finish typing up comments and feedback in the shared document.

In your group, have someone that is not from the code development team to try to install the software and review the code. If possible, get the code running. Work together to ask each other questions and learn from each other's projects. The idea is to streamline the process so that the repository and code organization are sufficient for someone outside of the development team to be able to install, test and understand the project without needing to have a developer to help.   As a group take lots of notes and review the project and give the development group some constructive feedback.  If you are a member of the code's development team, use this as an opportunity to fix problems as they are discovered. 

As a group, prepare a report for the instructor and the development team. This report should provide the following:

- Clearly label which teams code is being evaluated.
- Clearly label which team is doing the evaluation.
- Was the repository and code organized in an efficient manner?  
- Were you able to easily find the License, example code, reports, etc. 
- Is there anything that needed to be added to the repository to make the project easier to understand and navigate?
- Was there anything you could add to the project to help make the project better?

This is a group effort, email the report to the instructors and cc the other members of the code development team.
