Now that we are getting closer to the end of the semester we want you to start thinking about future projects. 

### STEP 1: Brainstorm ideas

Extend the list you came up with on the brainstorming assignment in class last week. Talk with your community partners and brainstorm new ideas. Build this list all semester and add to the list as the semester moves forward.  Follow the rules of brainstorming and record all of your ideas.  At this point there is no bad ideas and we are striving for quantity and variety.

### STEP 2: Selection Criteria

Extend the selection criteria your team came up with form the in-class brainstorming assignment.  Come up with criteria that are easily enumerated and comparable.  Refine the list as you better understand your own preferences. Describe each selection criteria in detail (1-2 sentences) such that people outside your group will understand them. 

### STEP 3: List Reduction

Group your ideas into categories and provide provide a short (1-2 sentences) description to clarify each idea.  List any ideas you got rid of by unanimous voting.  

### STEP 4: Apply Selection Criteria 

Apply the selection criteria to the above list and come up with 2-3 of the best ideas for future capstone projects. Make sure you show how these ideas best meet the criteria and what seemed to be the major deciding factors.

### STEP 5: Project Descriptions

Given the 2-3 best ideas type up a project description similar to the descriptions you received at the beginning of the semester. Each description should be 1-2 pages and include each of the four major data science steps.  

### STEP 6: Deliverables

Write a report and include the output of all of the above steps.  The goal here is to see your process and demonstrate that you came up with a well thought out solution. 

# Submission

Give your report a clear name and put a copy in your Teams_Management directory and send a link to the file to our instructors via email.

# EVALUATION

This project will be graded based on the thoughtfulness of your responses. In this case more is better, just try to make your ideas as clear as possible. We are looking for ideas for future capstone projects so the student input is pivotal. 

# After Submission

Review the feedback from the other teams and the instructors.  Address the feedback and use this report as a draft of the "Future work" section of your final report.  If there is a lot consider just highlighting the main points and putting the details of this report in an appendix.
