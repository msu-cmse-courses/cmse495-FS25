# Project Review

This is a tri-pod team exercise.  All Three teams will work together to review your projects. Combine your teams.  Have the teams take turns describing your projects and letting the other team ask questions. You can decide how best to share your projects.  **_Make sure not to violate any NDA_**

| Tripod V3 | Team A | Team B | Team C |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | CEPI | HFH_QC | TechSmith |
| 2 | HFH_MT | HFH_PP | TwoSix |
| 3 | HAP    | Grassroots | QSIDE |
| 4 | Documenters | MSU_JO | MSU_WD | 
| 5 | MSU_HC | HFH_RC | MSU_GR |

## Agenda

The purpose of this activity is to A) practice describing what your team is doing and B) getting ideas and help from your peers. 

- (10 minutes) Quick Introductions. Identify a timekeeper, notetaker, and facilitator.  
- (15 minutes) Review Project for Team A, Discussion and brainstorming about improvements 
- (15 minutes) Review Project for Team B, Discussion and brainstorming about improvements
- (15 minutes) Review Project for Team C, Discussion and brainstorming about improvements 
- (10 minutes) Finish typing up comments and feedback in the shared document.

Have the groups take turns.  Have someone from one team give a an impromptu update describing the project, what you are doing and what you need to finish up.  Pay special attention to any remaining open questions or other open loops.  The other team should provide feedback and support. 

As a group, prepare an email report for the instructor and the development team. This report should provide the following:

- Clear indication of which three teams interacted.
- Headers showing feedback for each team which include:
    - Ideas for improving on project description and presentation.
    - List of open questions that are still being explored.
    - Any feedback and generated during the discussion. 

This is a group effort, I recommend using a shared document and have multiple people take notes.
