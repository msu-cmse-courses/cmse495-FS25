# Asynchronous Class TODAY
Today we will NOT be meeting in person or online.  Teams are welcome to use the classroom but the instructors will not be there.  This is intended to give flexibility to students who may want to go and visit the solar eclipse. 

However, you are still responsible for completing the following in-class activity.  Please try to get this done before class on Wednesday. 

## Final Presentation Storyboard Feedback.
This will be a team-paring exercise.  Please connect with your partner team (see table below), exchange your storyboards and provide feedback as follows...

As a group, write an email report for the instructor and the other team. This report should provide the following:

- List the proposal team name and the evaluator team name.
- Ideas for making the video better.

Make sure you title the email and make it clear your group name and the group you are reviewing).  Email the group and the instructors to get credit.
