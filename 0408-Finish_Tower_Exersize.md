# 1. Finish Tower Code


&#9989; **<font color=red>DO THIS:</font>** Do a git pull on the tower project as it is so far.  Everyone in the course should be a devoper.  As a developer create a branch off the master and switch to that branch. Try to make changes in your branch instead of the main repository. 


&#9989; **<font color=red>DO THIS:</font>** Now lets finish the graph theory problem from last time.  I assume that this will take most of class today as well. Make and commit changes to your branch and issue a pull/merge request to the central repository.

&#9989; **<font color=red>DO THIS:</font>**  When you are done, go ahead and issue a pull request from your group.  This will be sent to the managment group to try organize all of the cod into one.

# 2. Group Presentations
