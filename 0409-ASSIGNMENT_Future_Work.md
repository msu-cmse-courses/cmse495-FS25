# Future Projects ideas

Now that we are getting closer to the end of the semester we want you to start thinking about future projects. 

### STEP 1: Brainstorm ideas

Extend the list you came up with on the brainstorming assignment from 0216. Talk with your sponsors and brainstorm new ideas. Build this list all semester and add to the list as the semester moves forward.  Follow the rules of brainstorming and record all of your ideas.  At this point there is no bad ideas and we are striving for quantity and variety.

### STEP 2: Selection Criteria

Extend the selection criteria your team came up with form the 0216 brainstorming assignment.  Come up with criteria that are easily enumerated and comparable.  Refine the list as you better understand your own preferences. Describe each selection criteria in detail (1-2 sentences) such that people outside your group will understand them. 

### STEP 3: List Reduction

Group your ideas into categories and provide provide a short (1-2 sentences) description to clarify each idea.  List any ideas you got rid of by unanimous voting.  

### STEP 4: Apply Selection Criteria 

Apply the selection criteria to the above list and come up with 2-3 of the best ideas for future capstone projects. Make sure you show how these ideas best meet the criteria and what seemed to be the major deciding factors.

### STEP 5: Project Descriptions

Given the 2-3 best ideas type up a project description similar to the descriptions you received at the beginning of the semester. Each description should be 1-2 pages and include each of the four major data science steps.  

### STEP 6: Deliverables

Write a report and include the output of all of the above steps.  The goal here is to see your process and demonstrate that you came up with a well thought out solution.
