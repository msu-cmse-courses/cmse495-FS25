# Future Project Proposal Reviews

This is a team paring exercise.  Your team will work with another team to review your future project proposals. Have each team review the Future work proposals.


## Agenda

- (5 minutes) Exchange Project Proposals
- (5 minutes) Quick Introductions. Identify a timekeeper, notetaker, and facilitator.
- (20 minutes) Review Project Proposals (read like you are a student handed this project, ask questions)
- (10 minutes) Discussion and brainstorming about improvements
- (20 minutes) Finish typing up feedback

Review the other teams project proposals. For each proposal think about if it is scoped correctly for a future capstone project. Is it too hard? Too Easy?  

As a group, write an email report for the instructor and the other team. This report should provide the following:

- List the proposal team name and the evaluator team name.
- Are the projects scoped appropriately for a CMSE495 course?  Is it too hard? Too easy?
- Does the description make enough sense for a student to make an informed choice to select one of these topics?
- What are some improvements that could be made on the description?

Make sure you title the email and make it clear your group name and the group you are reviewing (like last week).  Email the group and the instructors to get credit.
