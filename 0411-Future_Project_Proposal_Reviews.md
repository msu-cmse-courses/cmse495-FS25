## Agenda

- (5 minutes) Exchange Project Proposals
- (5 minutes) Quick Introductions. Identify a timekeeper, notetaker, and facilitator.
- (20 minutes) Review Project Proposals
- (10 minutes) Discussion and brainstorming about improvements
- (20 minutes) Finish typing up email to instructors

Review the other teams project proposals. For each proposal think about if it is scoped correctly for a future capstone project. Is it too hard? Too Easy?  

As a group, prepare a report for the instructor and the other team. This report should provide the following:

- List the proposal team name and the evaluator team name.
- Are the projects scoped appropriately for a CMSE495 course?  Is it too hard? Too easy?
- Does the description make enough sense for a student to make an informed choice to select one of these topics?
- What are some improvements that could be made on the description?

This is a group effort, email the report to the instructors and cc the other members of the proposal team.
