# In-Class Assignment: Data4Justice Conference

We will not have class today. Instead students are encouraged (not required) to register for the [data-4-justice-conference](https://qsideinstitute.org/events/data-4-justice-conference/) and attend some or all of their virtual presentations (depending on your class schedule).    


Make sure you register using your MSU Email address and use the "promocode" provided in class. If you do not remember the promocode please contact the instructors.
