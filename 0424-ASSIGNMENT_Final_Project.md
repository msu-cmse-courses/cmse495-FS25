The final project and all of it's milestone components are due on the last day of class.     Please double check all of the project assignments.

All projects should follow the same basic structure laid out at the beginning of the semester. File and folder naming is important but will vary by project.  Use meaningful names as described in prior assignments. Here is an example:

    ProjectName/
        .gitignore
        docs/
             package_name/
                  module1.html
                  module2.html
             images/
                  image1.jpg
        environments.yml
        Examples/
              datafile1.csv
              datafile2.tiff
              datafile3.xls
        LICENSE.txt
        makefile
        Reports/
             Meeting_Minutes.md
             Team_Charter.md
             Project_proposal.ipynb
             Closed_loop_Report.ipynb
        package_name/
              __init__.py
              module1.py
              module2.py
              test/
                  __init__.py
                  test_module1.py
                  test_module2.py
        README.md
        setup.py
        Final_Report.md
        Final_Report.pdf
        Installation_instructions.ipynb
        Figure1.ipynb
        Figure2.ipynb
        other.ipynb
    
The ```README.md``` file should be the first "touch point" in your repository. Assume that people new to the repository will start there.  Use that to guild your readers to the other parts.

<a name="Video"></a>

# 1. Create video

Use the storyboard and the feedback from your previous assignment as a guild to making the video. Do not be afraid to deviate from the plan if you have a new and exciting idea.  

Prepare the presentation for a general audience.  Make something that you could show to in-coming data science student (or a family member) to get them excited about the project. Also remember that your sponsor will be watching this presentation so think of this as an opportunity to "Wow" them. 

Some things to consider for your storyboard:

- Include who will be speaking for each slide. (All members of the team should talk).
- Use the notes field in the slide show program to outline what you want to say for each section of the video. 
- Include introductions for group members.  
- Describe the overall goals of the project.
- Describe your open-loops** and how you closed them. 
- Describe how the work will be broken up and solved.
- Plan not exceed the 10 minute talk length.

We really want to see creativity.  Think outside of slides and talking. Demonstrate to us why your project is awesome!

Let your instructor know what you are thinking, we may be able to show you some easy to use tools to produce your vision. 

** An open-loop is a part of the project for which you do not know what your solution will include.  

# 2. Final Report

The format for the final reports will vary by project but should probably have the following layout:

- Title
- List of Authors
- Abstract
- Background
- Methodology
- Results
- Concluding Discussion and Future Work
- Acknowledgements
- References
- Appendix

Please write the final report in either jupyter notebooks or Markdown and check them into your repository.  [Here is a template you can use that gives you more information](FINAL-Project_Template).  

# 3. Submission

Have one on your team email a link to the video to the instructors. Carbon Copy (CC) all members of your team (including yourself) and CC your sponsors (if they have asked to be included). The title of the email should be "**_GROUP NAME - CMSE495 Final Project_**"


# 4. Extensions

Everything is due by Sunday night April 24th.  However, teams may make changes to their repository (not their video) up until Friday April 29th. When you feel your project is complete, please share the repository as a zip file with your project sponsors. Make sure you cc your instructors so we know you are finished and start grading.
