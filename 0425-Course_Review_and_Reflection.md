# Iterative improvements

Today I would like you to think about ways to improve this course for students in the future. We talked about this a bit but we are looking for ideas that we can implement in the classroom, the assignments, etc to help prepare students for the open nature of the projects and help them learn and be successful.  

### Agenda for today's class (80 minutes)

1. (5 minutes) Final CATME
1. (15 minutes) Announcements
2. (70 minutes) Group work with instructor check-in


# 1. CATME team review

When you get to class, log onto CATME and provide a review of you and your team's performace on the slide development milestone.

# 2. Review Course goals and syllabus

To start lets review the slides and syllabus from day one. We can go over this quickly. I am interested to see if my plan for the semester met our expectations.  

# 3. Group breakout

In your groups, I would like you to think about at least two bullet points for each of the following (you will be sharing this with the class). This exercise is called "Start, stop and continue" and can be used as a way to adjourn a group. 

* What should the instructors start doing?

* What Should the instructors stop doing?

* What Should the instructors continue doing?

Share your ideas with the rest of the class.

# 4. Ideas for course improvement

Finnally as a class lets share our ideas and brainstorm other things we can do to make this course even better. Please recourd all ideas here:
