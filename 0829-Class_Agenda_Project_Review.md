# Project Review Presentations

Today we will break up into the same groups as Wednesday and review the project summaries and try to understand what will be needed to complete the project.  


## Agenda (70 Minutes)

- (10 minutes) Announcements
- (30 minutes) Project Review
- (20 minutes) Sharing review results


# 1. Announcements

## Honor's Option

If you are interested in an Honor's option, please review the option in the syllabus and send an email to your instructors **TODAY** saying you would like to be included in the SCHOLAR repository management team. 

# 2. Project Review

Your goal for the next half hour is to review a project as a group and do some preliminary research. Get out your computers so everyone can help.  After your 30 minutes you need to be ready to give a 3-minute presentation (max) to the entire class about the 2-3 most interesting things you found. The goal here is to share something new that may be helpful for other classmates to know as they pick projects. Practice if you have time so you can keep it under 3 minutes.
