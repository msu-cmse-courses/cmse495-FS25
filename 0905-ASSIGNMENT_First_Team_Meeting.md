# In-Class Assignment: First Team Meetings

Throughout the semester you will be expected to conduct regular team meetings (weekly).  For every team meeting you will identify a facilitator, time keeper and note taker (rotate these roles).  

***Your instructors will expect to be able to go to your team drives at any time during the semester and be able to review your up-to-date meeting notes.***  If they are not there your entire team will receive a zero and will not be able to make it up. 

Today we will be practicing for the first official meeting. To help you out we have provided a draft agenda:

## Meeting Agenda
- (5 minutes) Identify and record meeting roles (Note taker, Timekeeper, Facilitator).
- (5 minutes) Review this agenda (make changes as needed).
- (10 minutes) Create and share team git repository. (ensure your instructors are able to clone).
- (10 minutes) Review Milestone Assignments, finish up team charter and hand out "Next Actions" to everyone on the team. Next Actions should be clearly recorded in your meeting notes with who what and when information.

# Understanding Git

It is assumed that you have been introduced to git in previous classes. We will be using it a lot in this class. Students that are uncomfortable with git may want to review the following tutorials. It is the entire teams responsibility to help your fellow members learn and use git properly:

Another fun resource is the following game which tries to teach you git:
