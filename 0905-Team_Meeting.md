# Class Agenda

Key to your success this semester is working together as a group and being effective when you are together.  Today we are going to practice conducting meetings. 

## Class Agenda

Make sure you sit with your team.  Make sure you have a "team name tag". You will be expected to do this each class without reminders. Remember your team name tag should include:

- Team Logo
- Names of team members

# 1. Tower Building Exersize

Instructor has slides for this (with surprises)

# 2. Team Organization - Roles

As a class we will discuss ways that you can organize your teams. Often it is helpful to assign permanent or temporary team roles to help divide the responsibility and help keep people on track.

How you ultimately decide to organize your team is up to you but you will be expected to communicate your organizational structure to your instructors for feedback. It is recommended that you try to keep things simple to start. 

Use your Team Charter assignment to write down how you would like to self govern.  Individuals should have more than one Role and it may be helpful to identify a Primary and Secondary person for each role. An example set of roles you could include in your team charter include:

## Suggested Capstone Team Roles (Collaborative Leadership Model)

Each team member is expected to contribute to all aspects of the project.  The following is a list of suggested leadership roles your team could use to help ensure leadership and coordination in key aspects of the project.  Each member of the team can have more than one role. During meetings you can have a report from each roles o make sure you are covering all of your needs. Your team should decide what roles make the most sense for your project.  

For each role it is recommended that you assign a primary and secondary person to work as a team (in case someone is absent or needs help).  For the following a team of five students would need four roles. It may be helpful to consolidate or change the roles to better match the team size and project. Also be flexible and willing to adjust throughout the semester based on lessons learned.
