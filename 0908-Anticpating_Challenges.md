# Team Charter Review

Each team create a feedback file in your shared folder under the General Chanel on Teams. Name the file ```YYYYMMDD_Team_Charter_Review.docx```.

***The goal of this exercise is to make the Team Charter's better and avoid common problems.  Everyone is encouraged to add comments and suggestions to the "Team Charter Review" documents.***

We will start with a team paring exercise.  Your instructor has put you into the following group of teams (aka Tripod).  

| Tripod | Team A | Team B | Team C |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | HFH_MT | Justair | MSU_Deer_Drones |
| 2 | MSU_Curriculum | MxV_Rail | WBTPD |

In a circular path, review the team charters for all of the teams in your tripod. Have someone from each team team do a quick presentation of their charter to the other teams(5 minutes per team). Make sure you suggest changes to other charters and your own.

(Pick things to share at the end of the class). 

# Example Case Study: Not Enough Training Data
For this exercise your groups will review one of the case studies in the following page. 

To get some practice, the entire class will review the first case study to give you an idea what you should be doing.  challenges

# Group Case Studies

In your individual groups, spend about 30 minutes to review the handout of the remainder of the case studies. You should have time to get through about three (3) of them (more is fine).  We don't want all groups to do the same studies so start with the case study in the table below.  Spend about 10 minutes per case study by doing the following:

- Pick someone to keep track of time
- Pick someone to take notes
- Pick someone to read the case study out loud and have a discussion
- Discuss the questions at the end of the case study.
- Focus on the question "What could be added to improve the team charter's team charter that may help avoid this type of problem?"

| Team | Case | 
|--------|--------| 
| MSU Curriculum - Curriculum Mapping | 2\. Case Study: Visit from the CEO |
| Justair - Air Monitoring Startup | 4\. Case Study: Team Conflict |
| MSU Deer Drones - Satellite Imaging | 6\. Case Study: What is the best accuracy? |
| MvX Rail - Safty Monitoring | 8\. Case Study: Working Alone |
| HFH MT - Motion Tracking | 10\. Case Study: Divergent Paths in Model Selection |
| WBTPD - Patrol Optimization | 12\. Tool or Platform Failure |

# Sharing with the class

The instructor will have groups share what they learned with the class.  The important outcome will be ideas you think are good to add to the team charter to help anticipate challenges that may occur throughout the semester. 

# Introduce Project Schedule assignment

The next deliverable is the project plan and schedule.  Teams will use this time to read though the assignment and work on getting ready for the next steps.
