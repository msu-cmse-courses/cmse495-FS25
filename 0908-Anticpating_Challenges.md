# Anticipating Challenges


## Agenda (70 Minutes)

- (10 minutes) Example Case Study
- (30 minutes) Group Case Studies
- (20 minutes) Team Charter Review
- (10 minutes) Sharing with the class

# Reminder: Both Individual and Team 3x3 Reports due every Monday (starting today)

- [Link to 3x3 report instructions](Weekly-3x3)

# Example Case Study: Not Enough Training Data
For this exercise your groups will review one of the case studies in your handout. However, to get some practice, you instructor will lead the entire class in the first case study to give you an idea what you should be doing.

### Group Case Studies

As a group, spend about 30 minutes to review the handout of the remainder of the case studies. You should have time to get through about three (3) of them (more is fine).  We don't want all groups to do the same studies so start with the case study in the table below.  Spend about 10 minutes per case study by doing the following:

- Pick someone to keep track of time
- Pick someone to take notes
- Pick someone to read the case study out loud and have a discussion
- Discuss the questions at the end of the case study.
- Focus on the question "What could be added to your team charter that may help avoid this type of problem?"

| Team | Case | 
|--------|--------| 
| MSU Curriculum - Curriculum Mapping | 2\. Case Study: Visit from the CEO |
| Justair - Air Monitoring Startup | 4\. Case Study: Team Conflict |
| MSU Deer Drones - Satellite Imaging | 6\. Case Study: What is the best accuracy? |
| MvX Rail - Safty Monitoring | 8\. Case Study: Working Alone |
| HFH MT - Motion Tracking | 10\. Case Study: Divergent Paths in Model Selection |
| WBTPD - Patrol Optimization | 12\. Tool or Platform Failure |

# Team Charter Review

This is a team paring exercise.  Your instructor has put you into the following team of teams (aka Tripod).  

| Tripod | Team A | Team B | Team C |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | HFH_MT | Justair | MSU_Deer_Drones |
| 2 | MSU_Curriculum | MxV_Rail | WBTPD |

In a circular path, review the team charter for the other teams. Have someone from the team that wrote the team charter present it to another team (10 minutes).  Discuss key features and how you try to anticipate challenges for the semester.  Have the reviewing team brainstorm ideas to make the charter even better.  Type up your feedback and share with the other groups. 

# Sharing with the class

In the last 10 minutes of class your instructor will have groups share what they learned with the class.  The important outcome will be ideas you think are good to add to the team charter to help anticipate challenges that may occur throughout the semester. 

# Introduce Project Schedule assignment

The next deliverable is the project plan and schedule.  Teams will use this time to read though the assignment and work on getting ready for the next steps.
