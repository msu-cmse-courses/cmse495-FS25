## 3. Shout-Outs

I would like to try shout out outs in class. We are a big group. Please put shout out's in the general team's channel.  I may ask some of you to share out loud (if you want). 

## 4. Proposal Presentation

In two weeks, teams will be be giving their first presentation.  Your next deadline will be a full storyboard for the presentation (Due Sunday February 4th).

# ASSIGNMENT - Project Plan Reviews

Use your public team's folder in the Microsoft Teams "general" channel to share project plans with your tripod team:

| Tripod | Team A | Team B | Team C |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | HFH_MT | Justair | MSU_Deer_Drones |
| 2 | MSU_Curriculum | MxV_Rail | WBTPD |

As a group review the other team's proposal(s) and provide them some constructive feedback.  The more you can provide the better.  Please share your feedback in the team's folder.  Name the feedback something understandable with the data. For example ```YYYYMMDD_Proposal_Feedback_From_Team_XXXX.doc``` (where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the Day and XXXX is your short team name). Some things to think about include the following:

- Did you understand the goal and plan for this project? If not, what questions were not answered?
- Do you have any recommendations for the other team.
- Did reading though this proposal give you any ideas for your own teams project?
- Are their ways your teams could collaborate?
- Does the timeline look sufficient for completing the project?
- Are their any challenges the team may have failed to anticipate?
- Based on what you know, what grade would you give this proposal and why? (This is only as instructors)

When typing up the proposal feedback, try to avoid words like you/your when giving criticism (criticize the project not the people). Even better, word your criticisms as specific suggestions for improvements.  

When you are done writing up your feedback, read over your own teams feedback and ask for any clarifications.
