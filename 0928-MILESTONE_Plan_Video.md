For this assignment you and your team will create and submit a 3-5 minute video demo of your project plan. Tap into your own creativity. This video will be given to your community partners.  Make something you are proud of and would want to post on-line or include in a presentation. 

We will use time in class to watch the videos, answer questions and provide feedback.

**_NOTE_**:  Your instructor assumes that you are well past the planning stage and are actively working on closing your open loops.

# Create video

Use the storyboard and the feedback from your previous assignment as a guild to making the video. Do not be afraid to deviate from the plan if you have a new and exciting idea.  

Prepare the presentation for a general audience.  Make something that you could show to in-coming data science student (or a family member) to get them excited about the project. Also remember that your community partner will be watching this presentation so think of this as an opportunity to "Wow" them. 

Reminder of some things to consider for the video:

- Include who will be speaking for each part of the video. (Ideally all members of the team should be included in the planning video, although this is not strictly required).
- Make a script of what you want to say for each section of the video. 
- Include quick introductions for group members.  (Be creative with your time, for example onscreen "nametags" can help speed up introductions)
- Here is a list of things you could include in the presentation. You may not be able to include everything so try keep your message clear and professional:
    - Describe the overall goals of the project.
    - Describe your plan and timeline for a successful project.
    - Describe the major open-loops** that will need to be solved (closed).  
    - Describe how the work will be broken up and solved.
    - Describe you you will measure successful outcomes. 
- Plan to not exceed the 5 minute video length. (we need to watch all videos in class so shorter is better).  

We really want to see creativity.  Think outside of slides and talking. Demonstrate to us why your project is awesome!

Let your instructor know what you are thinking, we may be able to show you some easy to use tools to produce your vision. 

** An open-loop is a part of the project for which you do not know what your solution will include.

# Video Recording/Editing/Posting Software
 
The following are a few examples of tools you should be able to get for your home computers. Search the Internet for tutorials and feel free to reach out to the instructors for ideas. 

- [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/tutorial-snagit.html) Another screen capture program available to Students (or with a free trial). Snagit, is a simple to use video capture program developed by TechSmith (A local company with lots of MSU alumni). A free version of Snagit is available temporarily as long as it is only used for Classwork. You may be able to download it for free here at [msu.onthehub.com](https://msu.onthehub.com).
- [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/) Another really good capture and editing program by TechSmith. This is their elite editing program with a ton of features.  You may need to give yourself some time to learn how to use the program. A free version of Camtasia is available temporarily as long as it is only used for Classwork. You may be able to download it for free here at [msu.onthehub.com](https://msu.onthehub.com)camtasia-studio-tutorial.html).
- [Zoom](http://zoom.msu.edu): Although primarily intended for live communication,  the Zoom program we use in class is really good at recording video and what you are doing on your desktop.  
- [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/) an Open Source video editor.  
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) Open Source command line video conversion tool. Great for taking a folder of images and combining them into an animated video.  
- [YouTube](https://YouTube.com/) - You all know this one.  On-line video posting tool.
- [MediaSpace](https://mediaspace.msu.edu/) Slightly more secure place to post on-line video. Post here if you want to limit video watching to just your instructors and fellow students.

There are probably hundreds of other tools you could use.  Don't be afraid to see what is available on your smart phones and tablets.  

## Recording Studio

The instructor encourages students to use good quality microphones and cameras whenever possible.  

Teams can  schedule time in in a very small recording studio in the main engineering building (Room 1508B just north of the first floor CMSE TA Help Room, [Link to Map](https://cmse.msu.edu/About/directions.aspx)).  The studio is available most workdays from 9-4pm.    This is more of a recording studio with good quality microphones but it also has cameras and a green screen (although not much space to move around,  see images below). 

To use the studio you must request access by sending your preferred times to cmsetech@msu.edu. Make sure you include some flexibility as someone will need to be available to provide access to the room and others may be using the room as well. 

If you would like to try and use the studio it is highly recommended you make at least two (2) appointments. One to check out the studio and get a feel for the equipment and another to make your recordings.

# Creating your video

There are three basic types of video you may want to develop:

1. Audio/Video of you talking about your research.
2. Screen capture of slides or demo software.
3. Computer generated animations and transitions. 

If you set up a camera such as your phone or your laptop to record yourself, make sure it is on a stable surface and that the background is uncluttered and make sure the sound quality is clear.  

----
<a name="Editing_your_video"></a>

# Editing your video

Although some of you may be able to create your video in one recording.  Generally it is better if you edit your audio and video. Use the editing tools and think about ways to combine the different types of video you created.  Please talk with the instructors if you need help, they have a lot of experience editing videos.

<a name="Posting_your_video"></a>

# Posting your video

You may post your video someplace accessible by your instructor and other students (Public posting is not required for submission).  Probably the easiest place to post is on [YouTube](http://youtube.com/) using a personal Google Account or just upload the file to your video file to a Google drive folder. However, students can also post on the [MSU Mediaspace](http://mediaspace.msu.edu/). Once up on MediaSpace you can limit access to only MSU people logged in that have access to the URL.  

Please include a link to the URL in a place that is obvious to the instructors.  A good place would be to embed the video or include the URL in the git ```README.md``` file and the Readme file in your Microsoft Team directory.


----
# Submission
Put two copies of your final video in the class team drive; one inside your private team folder and one in your public team folder in the general channel. 

Have someone on your team email a usable link to the video (or file) to the community partners. Carbon Copy (CC) all members of your team (including yourself) and CC your instructors. The title of the email should be "**_GROUP_NAME-CMSE495_Plan_Presentation_Video_**".

---
# Evaluation

Videos will be graded for professionalism and completeness.  Instructors will count off points for poor quality sound or visualizations. This video will specifically want to see a introduction to the project and a clear plan for success.  Show everything from inputs, to how the data is processed to outputs. Here is a planned breakdown of the score:

 - 40 Video Content and Completeness
 - 30 Professionalism and Presentation
 - 20 Audio / Visual Quality
 - 10 Proper Submission and Sharing
