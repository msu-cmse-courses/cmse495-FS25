# Storyboard Review

This is a team tripod exercise.  Your team will work with another team in your tripod to review your MVP video storyboards.   As a group, write a report for the instructor and the other team. This report should provide the following:

- List the proposal team name and the evaluator team name.
- Ideas for making the video better.

Put a copy of the feedback in the teams public folder.

# Next Week! Minimum Viable Product Videos

Next you will turn in your minimal MVP product video presentations.  This video will be played in the class and your group will be asked questions about your project. This is the second of three major videos this semester.  You will be given 3-5 minutes for your video. Use the time wisely.
