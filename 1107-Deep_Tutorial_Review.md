# Tutorial Reviews

Conduct a meeting to review your assigned tutorial as a team. Make sure you have a timekeeper, facilitator and note taker for your meeting.

Review your partner team's tutorials and provide feedback in the form of either an issue on the gitlab issues page and/or a pull request.  When you are done, please review any other tutorials as you have time and are interested.

Summarize in an email to your instructor the following (make sure you cc your entire team):

- Which tutorial did you review
- What issues did you find (include a list with numbers)
- What pull requests did you submit (include a list with numbers).

After you have submitted the email to your instructions share a copy with the team that made the tutorial.

# Next week

Once you have successfully submitted your pull request you can practice a 3 minute presentation for next week during class. During the demo, assume that each of your audience members can look up the tutorial on their computer and follow along.
