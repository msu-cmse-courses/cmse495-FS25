# Final Tutorial Presentation

Each team will give a ~5 minute demo describing their SCHOLAR tutorial.  Think of the presentation as an honest ad about the tool/package in the tutorial.  In a short time, try to encourage and explain why someone would want to use the tool/package. Please make sure you include the following information:

* Name of the Tutorial file so people can follow along.
* Describe the tool/package and why it may be useful.
* Answer the question "When should I use this tool/package?"
* What are the pros/cons of using this package.

If you would like to share your screen during the presentation please make sure you are able to log on to the course zoom room. 

During the demo, assume that each of your audience members can look up the tutorial on their computer and follow along.
