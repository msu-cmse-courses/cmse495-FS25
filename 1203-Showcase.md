## Lightning Talks
- Instructor will introduce each team one-by-one who will give a **short introduction presentation (3–5 minutes)** about their work. These are called **Lightning Talks**.
- All team members are encouraged to participate in the presentation.
- While one group presents, the other teams and visitors will be the audience. Then, the teams will rotate.



## Interactive Digital Poster Session
- After Lightning Talks, teams that are not presenting this round and visitors will walk around and interact with each team at their TV.
- Discussions during the poster session should be **flexible and dynamic**, allowing visitors to ask questions and engage with the team.
- Teams should be prepared to:
  - Give demos
  - Answer questions
  - Provide additional visuals
- Consider assigning roles within your team:
  - **Greeter**: Welcomes visitors and starts conversations
  - **Demo Lead**: Runs code or shows interactive elements
  - **Subject Expert**: Answers detailed questions
- Be adaptable and keep the conversation flowing until it is time to rotate!
