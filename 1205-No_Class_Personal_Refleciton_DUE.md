# TO TODAY - Final Reflection Assignment – Data Science Capstone

As we wrap up the semester, this is your opportunity to reflect on your journey through the Data Science Capstone. This reflection is not just a summary of what you did, but a thoughtful exploration of what you learned, how you grew, and what you would pass on to those who follow in your footsteps. This assignment is designed to help you:

- Recognize your learning and growth
- Appreciate your contributions and teamwork
- Share wisdom with future students

- How do you think your contributions impacted the success of the project?
- Compare your contributions to those of your teammates? Do you feel you contributed more or less than your teammates and how?

### 2. Learning and Growth

- Looking back at your weekly 3x3 reflections, what patterns do you notice about your involvement and growth?
- What are the most important skills or concepts you learned during the capstone?
- How did your understanding of data science evolve throughout the project?
- What surprised you about the process of completing a real-world data science project?
- How have you grown personally or professionally during this experience?

### 3. Challenges and Successes

- What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?
- What are you most proud of from this experience?
- What did you learn about collaboration and teamwork through this process?

### 4. Advice to Future Students

- If you could give one or two pieces of advice to future students in this class, what would they be?
- What do you wish you had known at the beginning of the capstone?
