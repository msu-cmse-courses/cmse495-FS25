# Team Meeting Agenda and Notes

Teams are expected to organize and conduct multiple formal team meetings each week to work on the projects.  Although some time will be provided during class to conduct meetings, students must work together to arrange regular meetings outside of class. 

***Teams are expected to also arrange regular meetings with their community partners to keep them informed about the progress of the project and ask questions. Teams will need to include the community partners when determining the content and frequency of these meetings.***

Meeting agendas are required for all meetings.  Time keepers are in charge of the meeting agendas.  If the meeting is planned a draft of the agend must be sent to the participants before the meeting to get feedback and updates.  If the meeting is not planned (like extra time in class) then the timekeeper should work with the meeting participants to quickly come up with an agenda before starting the meeting. A typical agenda would include the following:

- Meeting time, location and duration
- Meeting roles (facilitator, note taker and timekeeper) - These roles should change for each meeting.
- Who is expected to come to the meeting.
- Agenda items including; planned time devoted to the item and the person responsible for leading the discussion about the item during the meeting. 

The note tacker is in charge of documenting what was decided and completed during the meeting. Notes are required for all meetings and should include the following:

- Who Attended the meeting. Attendance
- List of decisions made and tasks accomplished during the meeting.
- List of next action items including; what needs to be done, who is responsible for the item and when this task will be complete. 

Agenda and meeting notes must be filed in the Microsoft Teams folder.  Teams can choose to store all notes in a single file and may combine the agenda and meeting notes together to make it easier to read.  All notes must be kept up to date, clearly organized and easily accessible by the instructors so that they may check in at any time to evaluate progress and provide feedback for the team.
