# Weekly 3x3 Updates (Due Mondays)

It is expected that everyone will email a individual weekly Three-by-Three reflection to their capstone team on or before class on Monday. Then on Monday the team will summarize their individual 3x3's into one group 3x3 reflection that they send to their instructor for feedback:

> A 3x3 reflection consists of three major topics with exactly three bullet points in each topic (not 2 or 4). The three topics include:
> 
> 1. What was accomplish since the last reflection.
> 2. Challenges, Questions or problems you are trying to solve.
> 3. Your plans for next week.
>   
> Each of the 9 bullets in the 3x3 reflection should be no longer than a couple of sentences. Additional details can be placed in the same email after the report (not required).

Only email your personal reflection to your team and not to the instructors. Instead copies of your personal reflections need to be added to the team's Microsoft Teams folder so that the both the team and instructors can review them as needed. It is expected that team member's will read each other's reflections and provide support and feedback either in-person or via email.  

On Mondays each team will then summarize the information from their personal 3x3s into a team Three-by-three (3x3) reflection which they will email to the instructors (cc all team members). The team 3x3 reflection will consist of the same three major topics with exactly three bullet points but from the team's perspective. The instructors will read and respond to the team's 3x3 each week.  

***Please send the team reflection to the instructors as formatted email text and not as an attachment. However, the copy in your Teams folder can be stored as a word document.*** 

An example typical reflection would have the following format:

---

> ## SUBJECT: \<\<Your Name>>: 3x3 for DATE
>
> Hello Team,
> 
> Below is my 3x3 reflection for the week. \<\< A few extra sentences to highlight something of importance\>>
>  - \<\<Your name>>
> 
> My accomplishments for the week:
> * \<\<First thing>>
> * \<\<Second thing>> 
> * \<\<Third thing>>
>
> Questions/Challenges:
> * \<\<First Question/Problem>>
> * \<\<Second Question/Problem>>
> * \<\<Third Question/Problem>>
>
> My plans for next week:
> * \<\<First goal>>
> * \<\<Second goal>>
> * \<\<Third goal>>
>
> \<\< Additional Details if needed>>
---

After mailing your 3x3, put a coy of the reflection in a folder inside your team drive.
