# Weekly 3x3 Updates (Due Wednesdays)

It is expected that each team will email a weekly Three-by-three (3x3) reflection to the instructors every Monday (cc all team members). The 3x3 reflection will consist of three major topics with exactly three bullet points in each topic (not 2 or 4). The three topics include;  1) What your team accomplish since your last report, 2) Challenges, Questions or problems your team is trying to solve  3) Your teams plans for next week.   Each of the 9 bullets in the 3x3 reflection should be no longer than a couple of sentences. Additional details can be placed in the same email after the report (not required). 

A typical report would have the following format:
