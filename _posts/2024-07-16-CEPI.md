The Spring 2024 Data Science Capstone (CMSE 495) provides students with end-to-end project experience to apply the skills they have learned to solve real-world problems, practice professionalism, and build relationships with community partners.  

This project works with the State of Michigan [Center for Educational Performance and Information (CEPI)](https://www.michigan.gov/cepi), which is responsible for collecting and reporting education-related data in Michigan. In CEPI’s Office of Integration and Support, part of the Quality Assurance Team’s work involves producing dense reports using Excel to identify erroneous data and to highlight where the company must act; this is often referred to as anomaly detection. These Excel reports tend to be difficult and time-consuming to produce since the team must create them manually. Additionally, these reports are too difficult to read and navigate to be properly actionable. The goal of this project is to build a tool using Microsoft Power BI dashboards that automates the creation of these reports, makes them visually appealing, and allows users to easily understand the trends and anomalies in the data.  

While CEPI uses data from all levels of education, this project will specifically work with postsecondary education data. This data consists of information about student demographics, awards, programs, and courses from community colleges and universities. CEPI generates reports of this data to analyze and catch any anomalies. One example of an anomaly would be rapid change in counts within a certain timeframe, such as a university's total student count drastically increasing or decreasing. CEPI wants to include this in their reports to allow their team to address such issues. 

This project will build on work done by a group from the 2023 Capstone course. They identified anomalies using static percentage thresholds. We aim to reproduce this methodology, while introducing new anomaly detection methods that are better suited to handle the varying sizes of the categories we’re dealing with. Though we haven’t settled on our final anomaly detection process, we are considering implementing KNN and other classification methods as they are more robust than basic thresholds. These anomalies will then be visualized in an easy-to-read Power BI dashboard. We aim to build upon the bar charts and line plots produced by the 2023 Capstone team with visualizations better suited for data with large dimensionality. We are designing different layouts to find the best ways to show the necessary anomalies in a way that is readable and attractive. 

One of this project's main objectives is to build a tool that is easy to use for the CEPI team. They would like to be able to use what we build on future data sets. To do this, we will integrate our preprocessing steps to Power BI as we aim to centralize the anomaly detection/visualization and report generation process in this platform. We have members of our team actively working on figuring out the easiest and most foolproof way of going about this. 

A successful project will be achieved if the CEPI team is happy with our product, and we have made significant improvements to what was built by the 2023 Capstone team. We will consider the project accomplished if, with minimal effort, CEPI can convert a raw dataset to a report on the anomalies they are interested in. Lastly, the CMSE department at MSU has built a healthy relationship with CEPI, and we seek to only strengthen that. 

Throughout working on this project, our team will be building both technical and professional skills. We will learn how to use Power BI, a tool new to most of our team, for designing our dashboard. This entails not only learning how to create the graphs and tables we need, but also looking into ways to link our anomaly detection methods with Power BI to create a seamless pipeline. We expect this part of the project to be a great opportunity to improve our existing Python skills while developing proficiency in a new software. We will also need to explore anomaly detection methods of varying complexities, assessing their strengths and limitations to choose a method suitable for our project. This method must improve upon the previous capstone’s project method and consider the intricacies of the education data. 

Importantly, we will be learning how to navigate the balance between the technical side of project development and the professional side. We must ensure that these technical processes like anomaly detection models are comprehensible and actionable for people with non-technical backgrounds at CEPI and beyond. For example, the CEPI team has mentioned that they will present their anomaly reports to more business-minded people, meaning that it must be clear why data deemed anomalies under our new methods receive that classification.  Therefore, we must hone our professional communication skills and design our project with the intended audience in mind. We are striving to communicate our ideas effectively and professionally to CEPI in our weekly discourse with them. We will iterate upon any feedback we receive, thus allowing us to create a tool that CEPI finds useful and that we’re proud of.  

We are grateful to CEPI for this opportunity to utilize what we have learned throughout CMSE courses and to expand our data science skillsets. Not every major at Michigan State has a capstone course that allows them to work with a community partner. Furthermore, it is even less common that soon-to-be graduates get to have weekly meetings with members of the industry they’re interested in pursuing. We do not take these luxuries for granted and aim to show our appreciation through the quality of our work. Thank you CEPI!
