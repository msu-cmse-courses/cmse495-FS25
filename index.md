# CMSE 495 - Spring 2025 Data Science Capstone (Under Construction)

---

The CMSE 495 data science capstone course is intended to provide students with an opportunity to put together what they have learned across multiple courses to develop a final project that demonstrates their ability to work in a team on real-world problems.

The capstone course has three major goals:
1. Provide students with a high impact, end-to-end project experience where they can apply classroom experiences and data science skills to solve real-world problems. 
2. Provide students with opportunities to learn and practice professional skills (communication, teamwork and leadership) in the context of team-based projects.
3. Provide opportunities for students and faculty in the department to build relationships and network with industry partners, community organizations, and campus colleagues. 

## Team Projects
Michigan State University and the Department of Computational Mathematics Science and Engineering would like to thank these generous community partners for supporting our students.  A list of past community partners can be found by clicking on the following link:

- [Spring 2023 Partner List](./Partners-2023)
- [Spring 2024 Partner List](./Partners-2024)

If you have a project and are interested in being a future CMSE495 community partner for please reach out to the course instructor (Dr. Dirk Colbry <colbrydi@msu.edu>). For more information on becoming a project community partner please see our [Project community partner Page](./Seeking-Community_Partners)

## Course Structure
The class will meet three times a week during the 15-week semester. Classroom time will be divided across three broad activity categories:

- Project planning, team meetings, and reports
- Professional skills training
- Software development and technical skills training

When possible, the majority of time outside of class will be dedicated to tasks and deliverables that relate directly to the capstone teamsâ€™ projects.
